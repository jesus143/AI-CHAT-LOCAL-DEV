Hi Laine,

Thank you for your interest in my work! I'm excited to share details about the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI Chat Application** I've built.

## Quick Overview

I developed a full-stack RAG application that allows users to upload documents and ask intelligent questions about their content. The system combines document processing, vector similarity search, and local AI to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

**Key Features:**
- Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) via drag-and-drop interface
- Automatic text extraction, chunking, and vectorization
- Semantic search to find relevant context
- AI-powered responses based on document content
- Real-time chat interface using WebSocket

**Tech Stack:**
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), Node.js + WebSocket
- **AI/ML**: FAISS vector search, Sentence Transformers, Ollama LLM
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Architecture**: RESTful API + WebSocket real-time communication

## Technical Highlights

During development, I encountered and solved several interesting challenges:

1. **Multiprocessing Issues**: Debugged semaphore leaks from sentence-transformers' parallel processing conflicting with Flask. Implemented environment-level fixes that eliminated crashes.

2. **Library Compatibility**: Migrated from ChromaDB to FAISS to resolve Python 3.13 and macOS compatibility issues, improving performance and reducing complexity.

3. **RAG Pipeline**: Designed an efficient chunking strategy (500-char chunks with 50-char overlap) that balances context preservation with search accuracy.

## Documentation Attached

I've prepared detailed documentation:
- **PROJECT_BRIEF.md** - Quick 1-page overview
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** - Complete technical documentation (6 pages)
- **RAG_SETUP.md** - Installation and setup guide
- Full source code available upon request

## Demo

I'd be happy to provide:
- Live demonstration of the application
- Code walkthrough
- Technical discussion of any component
- Repository access

The application is fully functional and demonstrates practical AI/ML engineering, full-stack development, and production-ready coding practices.

Would you like to schedule a time for a demo, or would you prefer I send you the repository link?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,

Hi Laine,

Thank you for asking about my RAG project! I've built a full-stack application that enables document upload and AI-powered question-answering based on document content.

**What it does:**
- Users upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- System processes, chunks, and vectorizes the content
- Users ask questions in a chat interface
- AI retrieves relevant context and generates accurate answers

**Tech Stack:**  
Python (Flask), Node.js, FAISS vector search, Sentence Transformers, Ollama LLM, WebSocket for real-time chat

**Key achievement:** Solved complex multiprocessing issues and migrated from ChromaDB to FAISS for better compatibility and performance.

I've attached comprehensive documentation and would be happy to demonstrate the application or discuss the technical implementation.

Available for a demo at your convenience!

Best regards,

## Tips for Your Email

1. **Personalize it** - Add specific details about your conversation with Laine
2. **Match their style** - If they're technical, go detailed. If not, keep it high-level
3. **Show enthusiasm** - Express interest in discussing the project
4. **Be specific about next steps** - Offer a demo or meeting
5. **Attach the right docs** - Use PROJECT_BRIEF.md for most cases, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md if they want deep technical detail
